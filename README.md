Welcome to the **Memory Game** App!

This is a .NET project designed to demonstrate building a Blazor application that manipulates the state of a complex UI.

## Requirements

- [x] Your memory game should have a timer.
- [ ] Once a game is finished it should record the date it was played and the time it took to finish in a "games" table.
- [x] You should have just one level of difficulty.
- [x] Your game should have 9 cards.
- [x] The app should have two main components: the game and the games list.
- [x] You shouldn't need a database for the game functionality. All the information about the cards can be in lists in the code base.
- [ ] Since it only requires basic operations, use Entity Framework for recording game history.

## Challenges

- [x] Add difficulty levels to your game: more cards.
- [ ] Add a game against the clock: How many cards can the user match in a minute?
- [ ] Add a search functionality to the games list.
- [ ] Add a reports area where you'll query the database and show: How many games played per week/month/year and average score.
