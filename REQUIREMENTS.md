## Requirements

This application fulfills the following [The C# Academy - Memory Game](https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/40/memory-game) project requirements:

- [x] Once a game is finished it should record the date it was played and the time it took to finish in a "games" table.
- [x] You should have just one level of difficulty.
- [x] Your game should have 9 cards.
- [x] The app should have two main components: the game and the games list.
- [x] You shouldn't need a database for the game functionality. All the information about the cards can be in lists in the code base.
- [x] Since it only requires basic operations, use Entity Framework for recording game history.

## Challenges

This project has the following challenges:
- [x] Add difficulty levels to your game: more cards.
- [x] Add a search functionality to the games list.
