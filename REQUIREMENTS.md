## Requirements

This application fulfills the following [The C# Academy - Memory Game](https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/40/memory-game) project requirements:

- [ ] Your memory game should have a timer.
- [ ] Once a game is finished it should record the date it was played and the time it took to finish in a "games" table.
- [ ] You should have just one level of difficulty.
- [ ] Your game should have 9 cards.
- [ ] The app should have two main components: the game and the games list.
- [ ] You shouldn't need a database for the game functionality. All the information about the cards can be in lists in the code base.
- [ ] Since it only requires basic operations, use Entity Framework for recording game history.

## Challenges

This project has the following challenges:
- [ ] Add difficulty levels to your game: more cards.
- [ ] Add a game against the clock: How many cards can the user match in a minute?
- [ ] Add a search functionality to the games list.
- [ ] Add a reports area where you'll query the database and show: How many games played per week/month/year and average score.
